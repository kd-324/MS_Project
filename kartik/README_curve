curve(der_req)
abstract class for all the curve classes
der_req = derivatives required
member_functions:
  evaluate(u): It evaluates the curve at u
  derivatives(u): It returns a numpy array with derivatives upto
  der_req at u stored along the row. Note 0th derivative is func value.
  plot_data(ax): It plots the curve. ax is an axes object.

curve_object()
It creates a list of curves.
member_functions:
  add_beizer()
  add_B_spline()
  add_NURBS_curve()

NURBS_curve(cp, weight, der_req=2, deg=3)
cp = numpy array of control points. points are stored along the row. 
weight = weight of these control points stored in numpy array.
der_req = derivatives required
deg = degree of NURBS curve

beizer_curve(cp)
cp = numpy array of control points. points are stored along the row. 

 B_spline(cp, der_req=2, deg=3, show_cp = False)
cp = numpy array of control points. points are stored along the row. 
der_req = derivatives required
deg = degree of NURBS curve
show_cp = whether to plot control points or not

line(cp, der_req = 1)
cp is an array of two points through which line is to be passed

circular_arc(cp, der_req = 1)
cp is array of three points, starting, arbitary, ending point. arbitary
point is any point between the start and end point.
